Do the setup process as normal.

2.Make sure google play installs (you can tell that it has finished installing if you see a little briefcase icon on the notifications tab on the bottom right of the screen), as soon as it is finished installing turn off your internet connection so that it wont install any "managed applications."
make sure the blue icon turns grey.

after five minutes this screen should pop up signaling that you have succesfully bypassed CK Express and can now browse the web and use java bookmarklets unless there is another extension that prevents it.
