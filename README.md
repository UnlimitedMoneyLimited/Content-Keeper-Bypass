Alright I dont know how this shit works but here we go.

This has been tested ONLY on chromebooks versions 112-119

1. start by powerwashing your chromebook by pressing esc + refresh + power button,
as soon as you are back to this screen. (image below)

Do the setup process as normal. (if you get stuck in the enrolling screen just press esc 2 times)

2.STEP 2 ðŸ¤‘. make sure google play installs, as soon as it is finished installing immedietly turn off your internet connection so that it wont install any "managed applications"

go settings --> click on "Apps" --> click on "Manage your apps" --> click on the Google Play Store --> disable it.

Thats should be it and remember to not connect to your managed network if it does have a proxy on it since it can still block you, instead if your schol has a mobile network plan on
it then just connect to it or any other network works fine, you will be stuck in this loading screen of "initializing" but eventually you should end up with this.
NOTE that if you visit websites that even have just 1 ad, it will lag the crap out of you.
